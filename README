A First look at my MasterThesisApplication.

Main Topic: Similar images recogniotion based on a Visual Cortex approach.

Idea:
1* Filter images using a Gabor Filter.
2* Simulate a VFA to extract borders.
3* Try to create complex borders.
4* Try to build features without 'corners'.
5* Try to extract object according to the 4* and the colours.
6* Search for similar images :D.

So far done: 1*

Working @: 2*

Work pending. . . . .

***HOW TO:

***RUN THE APPLICATION
To take a look at all options, please do the following in Your bash shell:
./CandA -h

***OS REQUIREMENTS

1.System: Linux OS - Debian/Ubuntu/...
1.1 Preinstalled applications: ant, sun-java6, gnuplot, imagemagick, bash :D

***VERSIONS

v0.1.0
18.05.2010
* Creating an option, that will show the SinusFilter via gnuplot function plot (./CandA -H EXPORT).
* Setting Filters using Spring.
* Filtering with the sinus function are working!, but the parameters that are needed to work with it, are still waiting... For test, please try sth like:
./CandA -H FILTER -S "/home/switch486/one.png" -i 5 -u 5 -o 12


v0.0.9
16.05.2010
* Tuning the Gabor Filter parameters a bit.
* Adding a functionality to first of all (since this version) there is a possibility to create a Sinus function filter Matrix.
The idea is (Point 2*) to transform image, that is represented as pixels into an image that is represented with lines of the same length, that are the border of objects - from the Gabor Function results.
At the moment You are able to create a sinus-like 3d function that You can rotate.
* Only this functionality is working at the moment with this version. Searching for the most important one follows.....

v0.0.8
15.05.2010
* Created a script to run all 'Tests'
* Using imagemagick to merge the images - not used by java application yet...
* Cleaning the classes that were written before...
* Added a functionality to filter and join the images - a complete Gabor filter. 
For those, that are interrested, please take a look in the XXJoinFilter script, which 
contains the tests for this filter.

v0.0.7
14.05.2010
* Corrected the -v function, to allow fileHandler - before -v caused to remove the fileHandler and no logs were saved - only shown...
* Tuned the filter, because Gabor not only shows borders when the value is big, but also when it is low (normaly it would take 2 the time, to filter with a negative version of the filter Matrix), therfore a 
if (valueAfterfilteringForPixel <0){
	valueAfterfilteringForPixel = -valueAfterfilteringForPixel;
} 
is the desired solution.
* You are able to plot the FilterMatrix - see ./application -h for details 

v0.0.6
13.05.2010
* Plotting the Gabor filter using GnuPlot.
* Tuning the plot Parameters.
* Scripts to the parameter-plottings, see XX* files.

v0.0.5
12.05.2010
Created some architecture within the packages, passing parameters... And Command line nearly working

v0.0.4
Added Spring.

v0.0.3
Added an ant build-script, other scripts used for the compilation/run.

v0.0.2
Created a parser for the help option, and a logger to help debugging.

v0.0.1
Created Project with a simple Gabor Filter, and try to filter images with it.
