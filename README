A First look at my MasterThesisApplication.

Main Topic: Similar images recogniotion based on a Visual Cortex approach.

Idea:
1* Filter images using a Gabor Filter.
2* Simulate a VFA to extract borders.
3* Try to create complex borders.
4* Try to build features without 'corners'.
5* Try to extract object according to the 4* and the colours.
6* Search for similar images :D.

So far done: 1*

Work pending. . . . .



***OS REQUIREMENTS

1.System: Linux OS - Debian/Ubuntu/...
1.1 Preinstalled applications: ant, sun-java6, gnuplot, imagemagick, bash :D

***VERSIONS


v0.0.7
14.05.2010
* Corrected the -v function, to allow fileHandler - before -v caused to remove the fileHandler and no logs were saved - only shown...
* Tuned the filter, because Gabor not only shows borders when the value is big, but also when it is low 
(normaly it would take 2 the time, to filter with a negative version of the filter Matrix), therfore a 
if (valueAfterfilteringForPixel <0){
	valueAfterfilteringForPixel = -valueAfterfilteringForPixel;
} 
is the solution
* You are able to plot the FilterMatrix - see ./application -h for details 

v0.0.6
13.05.2010
* Plotting the Gabor filter using GnuPlot.
* Tuning the plot Parameters.
* Scripts to the parameter-plottings, see XX* files.

v0.0.5
12.05.2010
Created some architecture within the packages, passing parameters... And Command line nearly working

v0.0.4
Added Spring.

v0.0.3
Added an ant build-script, other scripts used for the compilation/run.

v0.0.2
Created a parser for the help option, and a logger to help debugging.

v0.0.1
Created Project with a simple Gabor Filter, and try to filter images with it.
