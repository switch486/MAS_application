A First look at my MasterThesisApplication.

Main Topic: Similar images recogniotion based on a Visual Cortex approach.

Idea:
1* Filter images using a Gabor Filter.
2* Simulate a VFA to extract borders.
3* Try to create complex borders.
4* Try to build features without 'corners'.
5* Try to extract object according to the 4* and the colours.
6* Search for similar images :D.

So far done: 1*

Work pending. . . . .
