abstract = {Visual object recognition is often assumed to be insensitive to changes in retinal position, leading to theories and formal models incorporating position-independent object representations. However, recent behavioral and physiological evidence has questioned the extent to which object recognition is position independent. Here, we take a computational and physiological perspective to review the current behavioral literature. Although numerous studies report reduced object recognition performance with translation, even for distances as small as 0.5 degrees of visual angle, confounds in many of these studies make the results difficult to interpret. We conclude that there is little evidence to support position-independent object recognition and the precise role of position in object recognition remains unknown.},

In the last few years the development of age appropriate batteries for assessing visual function in the first years and the combined use of neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques have allowed to achieve better understanding of the mechanisms underlying development of vision in low risk infants and in those with brain lesions. We will review the main models of visual development and the tests available to assess visual function in infancy, focusing on the recently described battery of tests for assessing early visual abilities in preterm and full term infants.},

Surprisingly, little quantitative modeling has been done to explore the biological feasibility of this class of models to explain aspects of higher-level visual processing such as object recognition. We describe a new hierarchical model consistent with physiological data from inferotemporal cortex that accounts for this complex visual task and makes testable predictions. The model is based on a MAX-like operation applied to inputs to certain cortical neurons that may have a general role in cortical function.},

@article{Stringer2002,
abstract = {To form view-invariant representations of objects, neurons in the inferior temporal cortex may associate together different views of an object, which tend to occur close together in time under natural viewing conditions. This can be achieved in neuronal network models of this process by using an associative learning rule with a short-term temporal memory trace. It is postulated that within a view, neurons learn representations that enable them to generalize within variations of that view. When three-dimensional (3D) objects are rotated within small angles (up to, e.g., 30 degrees), their surface features undergo geometric distortion due to the change of perspective. In this article, we show how trace learning could solve the problem of in-depth rotation-invariant object recognition by developing representations of the transforms that features undergo when they are on the surfaces of 3D objects. Moreover, we show that having learned how features on 3D objects transform geometrically as the object is rotated in depth, the network can correctly recognize novel 3D variations within a generic view of an object composed of a new combination of previously learned features. These results are demonstrated in simulations of a hierarchical network model (VisNet) of the visual system that show that it can develop representations useful for the recognition of 3D objects by forming perspective-invariant representations to allow generalization within a generic view.},

@article{Tootell1996,
abstract = {Recent developments in imaging and histology have greatly clarified our understanding of the nature and organization of human visual cortex. More than ten human cortical visual areas can now be differentiated, compared with the approximately 30 areas described in macaque monkeys. Most human areas and columns described so far appear quite similar to those in macaque but distinctive species differences also exist. Imaging studies suggest two general information-processing streams (parietal and temporal) in human visual cortex, as proposed in macaque. Several human areas are both motion- and direction-selective, and a progression of motion-processing steps can be-inferred from the imaging data. Human visual areas for recognizing form are less well defined but the evidence again suggests a progression of information-processing steps and areas, beginning posterior to the human middle temporal area (or V5), and extending inferiorly then anteriorly. This is consistent with findings from macaque, and with human clinical reports.},
